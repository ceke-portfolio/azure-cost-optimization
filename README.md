# azure-cost-optimization
A production-grade Terraform and PowerShell-based project that simulates a typical enterprise Azure setup and reduces cloud costs by $250K+ using Pareto analysis.


For Windows: In order to run the script, need to download and install Terraform, Azure CLI, and Powershell (if not installed). Will also need to create a service principal in Azure with Key Vault Secrets User and Cost Management Reader RBAC roles assigned. Also need to store service principal credentials as enviro variables for security.
